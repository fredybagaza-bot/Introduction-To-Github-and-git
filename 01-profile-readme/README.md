# Task 1: Create Your GitHub Profile README

GitHub has a special feature: if you create a repository with **the exact same name as your username**, its `README.md` file will display on your profile page. This is your personal landing page on GitHub.

---

## Steps

1. On GitHub, click the **+** button (top right) and select **New repository**.
2. Set the repository name to **your exact GitHub username** (e.g., if your username is `janedoe`, name the repo `janedoe`).
3. Make it **Public**.
4. Check **"Add a README file"**.
5. Click **Create repository**.
6. Click the pencil icon on the `README.md` to edit it.
7. Delete the default content and replace it with information about yourself. Use the template below as a starting point — copy it, paste it into the editor, then replace the placeholder text in `[brackets]` with your own information.
8. Scroll down, type a commit message (e.g., "Add my profile README"), and click **Commit changes**.
9. Visit your profile at `github.com/your-username` to see it live.

## Starter Template

Copy and paste this into your profile README, then replace everything in `[brackets]`:

```markdown
# Hi, I'm [Your Name]

## About Me
- I'm currently learning [what you're studying, e.g., "Computer Science at University of Nairobi"].
- I'm interested in [your interests, e.g., "AI, web development, and data science"].
- I'm looking to collaborate on [e.g., "beginner-friendly open source projects"].

## Skills I'm Building
- Git and GitHub
- [Add others, e.g., "Python", "HTML/CSS", "Machine Learning"]

## Current Projects
- [Project name](link) — short description

## How to Reach Me

```

## Make It Better

Once you have the basics working, you can enhance your profile:

- **Add badges and icons** using the [GitHub Profile README Generator](https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/).
- **Browse examples** for inspiration at [awesome-github-profile-readme](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme).
- **Add GitHub stats** by including a stats card (the generator above can help with this).

---

## What to Submit

When you are done, your instructor will check:

- [ ] You have a repository named **exactly** the same as your GitHub username.
- [ ] The repository is **public**.
- [ ] The `README.md` contains **your own information** (not the default template text).
- [ ] Your profile page at `github.com/your-username` displays the README.

**Submit:** Your GitHub profile link (e.g., `https://github.com/janedoe`).
